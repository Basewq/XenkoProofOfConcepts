# Bepu2 Physics Engine Example [BPE]

### WARNING: THIS NOT A COMPLETED PROJECT AND WILL NOT BE WORKED ON
### There is also no support to get this working on Stride

The purpose of this example is test integrating Bepu2 into Xenko.

All the relevant physics code is contained within the `BepuPhysicsExample.BepuPhysicsIntegration` folder.
`BepuPhysicsExample.Game` was an attempt to create the original Physics (Bullet) sample with Bepu.
`BepuPhysicsExample.GameStudioExt` makes the Bepu2 physics component appear in Xenko Game Studio (NOTE: this trick no longer works in Stride).

Currently, only the raycast shooting example works. The remaining examples require collider constraints, but this has not been implemented.
